Such models, referred to as NN dynamic models (NNDMs), use iterative noisy predictions of NN to estimate a distribution of system trajectories over time. Despite their accuracy, safety analysis of NNDMs is known to be a challenging problem and remains largely unexplored. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce a method of providing safety guarantees for NNDMs. Our approach is based on stochastic barrier functions, whose relation with safety are analogous to that of Lyapunov functions with stability. We first show a method of synthesizing stochastic barrier functions for NNDMs via a convex optimization problem, which in turn provides a lower bound on the system’s safety probability. A key step in our method is the employment of the recent convex approximation results for NNs to find piece-wise linear bounds, which allow the formulation of the barrier function synthesis problem as a sum-of-squares optimization program. If the obtained safety probability is above the desired threshold, the system is certified. Otherwise, we introduce a method of generating controls for the system that robustly minimize the unsafety probability in a minimally-invasive manner. We exploit the convexity property of the barrier function to formulate the optimal control synthesis problem as a linear program. Experimental results illustrate the efficacy of the method. Namely, they show that the method can scale to multi-dimensional NNDMs with multiple layers and hundreds of neurons per layer, and that the controller can significantly improve the safety probability.\n","date":1663113600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664746069,"objectID":"351241bf334204ea8303809b436e050c","permalink":"https://muvvalakaran.github.io/post/2022-09-14-nips22-paper/","publishdate":"2022-09-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2022-09-14-nips22-paper/","section":"post","summary":"TL;DR: In this work, we introduce a method of safety certification and control for neural network dynamic systems via stochastic barrier functions.","tags":null,"title":"One paper was accepted at the NeurIPS 2022 conference.

To be successful in our human-centric world, they must develop the ability to interact with unstructured environments. This includes performing complex tasks in face of changes in the environment and seeking collaborations with humans when possible. Achieving such capabilities is challenging, especially in the robotic manipulation domain, where tasks are complex and crucially require interaction with humans. In this talk, we propose a regret-based reactive synthesis framework to address some of these challenges. Intuitively, regret is a qualitative measure of the current action. If the action is optimal to the human’s response in hindsight, its regret is zero; otherwise, it is a positive value. Our aim is to synthesize strategies that minimize robot’s regret. This approach, unlike existing work, allows the robot not to necessarily view the human as an adversary, and hence, enabling it to explore cooperation with humans to accomplish a given task. Our focus is specifically on robotic manipulators with temporal logic task specifications in shared workspaces with humans. We show theoretical guarantees on task completion through reachability analysis by modeling the interaction as a two-player deterministic finite automaton game. We analyze various notions of regret, provide algorithms for their computations, and reason about the emergent behaviors.

While robots today thrive in industrial and lab settings, we must develop theories and algorithms that will enable the transition of these systems from robot-centric workspaces to the real-world. Hence, we want robotic systems not only to observe and react to the changes in the environment but also guarantee completion of the given task while ensuring safe execution. For robots operating in the presence of humans with non-contradicting goals, it is crucial to work together to save resources, time, and ensuring that everyone achieves their goals. Combining these objectives is challenging given the complexity of the tasks and various ways the system could interact with the environment.\nThis thesis blends different theories developed by the Formal Methods, Game Theory, and the Human-Robot Interaction community to develop a Regret Minimizing Framework (RMF) that addresses the above problems. While previous work using these approaches has assumed the human to be either purely adversarial or probabilistic, these assumptions are very conservative and eliminate the possibility of cooperation. This thesis proposes a notion of regret to synthesize high-level strategies for the robot that explores possible cooperation with the human while ensuring completion of the given task within some user-defined bound on the total energy spent by the robot. This work analyzes and implements various notions of regret and reasons about their emergent behaviors.

As such these robots are either manually operated or autonomous in highly restricted and well-defined environments and are extremely susceptible to changes in the environment - due to human intervention or any other external factor. This study focuses on developing a strategy for the robot to achieve a complex task. The synthesized strategy generates controllers for the robot in reaction to human interventions that cause changes in the environment . This strategy also accounts for the resource constraints of the robot such as time and energy. Using methods derived from formal methods and games we can then define quantitative safety-critical guarantees with optimal strategies.\n","date":1582243200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664746069,"objectID":"fc0dc8257db6efd5f765c72c4e52487d","permalink":"https://muvvalakaran.github.io/talks/cu_gearrs/","publishdate":"2022-07-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/cu_gearrs/","section":"talks","summary":"Presented my work on quantitative reactive synthesis for robotic applications.","tags":[],"title":"Quantitative Reactive Synthesis for Manipulators via Games","type":"talks"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
