      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paper Title&lt;/strong&gt;: Safety Guarantees for Neural Network Dynamic Systems via Stochastic Barrier Functions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;: Neural Networks (NNs) have been successfully employed to represent the state evolution of complex dynamical systems.  Such models, referred to as NN dynamic models (NNDMs), use iterative noisy predictions of NN to estimate a distribution of system trajectories over time. Despite their accuracy, safety analysis of NNDMs is known to be a challenging problem and remains largely unexplored.  To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce a method of providing safety guarantees for NNDMs.  Our approach is based on stochastic barrier functions, whose relation with safety are analogous to that of Lyapunov functions with stability.  We first show a method of synthesizing stochastic barrier functions for NNDMs via a convex optimization problem, which in turn provides a lower bound on the system&amp;rsquo;s safety probability.  A key step in our method is the employment of the recent convex approximation results for NNs to find piece-wise linear bounds, which allow the formulation of the barrier function synthesis problem as a sum-of-squares optimization program.  If the obtained safety probability is above the desired threshold, the system is certified.  Otherwise, we introduce a method of generating controls for the system that robustly minimize the unsafety probability in a minimally-invasive manner.  We exploit the convexity property of the barrier function to formulate the optimal control synthesis problem as a linear program.  Experimental results illustrate the efficacy of the method. Namely, they show that the method can scale to multi-dimensional NNDMs with multiple layers and hundreds of neurons per layer, and that the controller can significantly improve the safety probability.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Paper Title: REASON-RECOURSE Software for Science Operations of Autonomous Robotic Landers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Project Name: NASA COLDTech --&gt;
&lt;!-- Abstract: Future planetary exploration missions on the surface of distant bodies such as Europa or Enceladus can’t rely on human-in-the-loop operations due to time delays, dynamic environments, limited mission lifetimes, as well as the many unknown unknowns inherent in the exploration of such environments. Thus our robotic explorers must be capable of autonomous operations to ensure continued operations and to try to maximize the amount and quality of the scientific data gathered from each mission. To advance our technology toward this goal, we are developing a system to maximize the science obtained by a robotic lander and delivered to scientists on Earth with minimal asynchronous human interaction. The autonomy architecture consists of two main components: REASON (Robust Exploration with Autonomous Science on-board) and RECOURSE (Ranked Evaluation of Contingent Opportunities for Uninterrupted Remote Science Exploration) for efficient and useful scientific communication between scientists and robot. The key advantage to this design is in its ability to continuously operate and adapt despite the constraints of high-latency, low-bandwith communications and an uncertain environment which today would require ground-in-the-loop operations. This paper presents the initial version of the REASON-RECOURSE system. Details of the implementation of the scientist interface and interaction with the ground software - RECOURSE - and the on-board robotic planning software - REASON - are given. Demonstration of the operation using NASA&#39;s OceanWATERS testbed will be shown. --&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Paper Title: Expert-Informed Autonomous Science Planning for In-situ Observations and Discoveries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Name: NASA COLDTech&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Future planetary exploration missions on the surface of distant bodies such as Europa or Enceladus can’t rely on human-in-the-loop operations due to time delays, dynamic environments, limited mission lifetimes, as well as the many unknown unknowns inherent in the exploration of such environments. Thus our robotic explorers must be capable of autonomous operations to ensure continued operations and to try to maximize the amount and quality of the scientific data gathered from each mission. To advance our technology toward this goal, we are developing a system to maximize the science obtained by a robotic lander and delivered to scientists on Earth with minimal asynchronous human interaction. The autonomy architecture consists of three main components: Shared Science Value Maps (SSVMs), which function as an interface between REASON (Robust Exploration with Autonomous Science on-board) and RECOURSE (Ranked Evaluation of Contingent Opportunities for Uninterrupted Remote Science Exploration) for efficient and useful scientific communication between scientists and robot. The key advantage to this design is in its ability to continuously operate and adapt despite the constraints of high-latency, low-bandwith communications and an uncertain environment which today would require ground-in-the-loop operations. This paper presents the overview of our architecture and initial results on the development of such a system. These results will focus on progress made in developing the details of the SSVM interface between human scientists and robotic explorer and the ability of REASON to act on the SSVM to develop plans on-board that attempt to maximize science obtained while being guaranteed to respect any relevant system and safety constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;: From Autonomous cars, factories to households, we envision a future where robots work safely and efficiently alongside humans. While robots today thrive in industrial and lab settings, we must develop theories and algorithms that will enable the transition of these systems from robot-centric workspaces to the real-world. Hence, we want robotic systems not only to observe and react to the changes in the environment but also guarantee completion of the given task while ensuring safe execution. For robots operating in the presence of humans with non-contradicting goals, it is crucial to work together to save resources, time, and ensuring that everyone achieves their goals. Combining these objectives is challenging given the complexity of the tasks and various ways the system could interact with the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thesis blends different theories developed by the Formal Methods, Game Theory, and the Human-Robot Interaction community to develop a Regret Minimizing Framework (RMF) that addresses the above problems. While previous work using these approaches has assumed the human to be either purely adversarial or probabilistic, these assumptions are very conservative and eliminate the possibility of cooperation. This thesis proposes a notion of regret to synthesize high-level strategies for the robot that explores possible cooperation with the human while ensuring completion of the given task within some user-defined bound on the total energy spent by the robot. This work analyzes and implements various notions of regret and reasons about their emergent behaviors. An end-to-end synthesis toolbox is developed to compute regret minimizing strategies, which implements various optimization techniques to help scale the algorithms to the robotics domain and illustrate the efficacy of the optimal strategies through various case studies.&lt;/p&gt;
